- Engineering specification (`sidereal-engineering-summary.md`) — the canonical design document
- Complete ATO documentation package under `compliance/`
- Implementation plan at `~/.claude/plans/keen-bouncing-unicorn.md` (completed)
- Full operator implementation: 8 CRDs, 6 controller reconcilers, 5 built-in probe runners + custom extensibility, Rust detection probe (9 MITRE ATT&CK techniques), HMAC integrity, multi-framework crosswalk (7 frameworks), SIEM export (5 formats, 3 backends), incident/alert/authorization lifecycle, discovery engine with CLI, report generation (5 types), Helm chart (6 profiles), FIPS 140-2 builds, CI/CD pipeline. 260 Go tests + 15 Rust tests + 46 E2E tests.

**Repo**: `primaris-tech/sidereal` on GitHub (private).

**Status**: Tagged v0.1.0. Post-v0.1.0 work includes: community feedback, E2E test hardening on real clusters, additional crosswalk refinement, and eventual public release.

## What Sidereal Is

A Kubernetes-native security operator for **continuous security control validation** on federal systems (FISMA, FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, CMMC, CJIS, and other frameworks). It runs targeted, low-impact probes against a live cluster to verify that security controls are *operationally effective* — not merely configured. Differentiated from existing tools (Kubescape, Stratus Red Team, Falco) by being the only OSS/CNCF-fit tool that is simultaneously continuous, actively probing, validates the detection layer, supports multi-framework compliance mapping, and generates ISSO-ready reports.

Probe surfaces: RBAC, NetworkPolicy, Admission Control, Secret Access, Detection Coverage (Falco/Tetragon), and Custom (operator-extensible).

## Architecture

**Deployment**: Kubernetes Operator pattern deployed via Helm into `sidereal-system` namespace.

**Implementation stack**:
- Controller Manager: Go with kubebuilder/controller-runtime, BoringCrypto FIPS (CMVP #3678)
- Go probe runners: RBAC, NetworkPolicy, Admission Control, Secret Access
- Rust detection probe: aws-lc-rs FIPS (CMVP #4816), scratch base, no network/no mounts

**Core CRDs** (8 total, API group `sidereal.cloud/v1alpha1`):
- `SiderealProbe` — probe configuration; maps to MITRE ATT&CK technique + multi-framework controls; includes `targetNamespace` or `targetNamespaceSelector`, `executionMode` (`dryRun`/`observe`/`enforce`), `intervalSeconds`; supports built-in and `custom` probe types
- `SiderealProbeResult` — append-only audit record; HMAC-verified; TTL per impact level (365d High/Moderate, 180d Low); unified outcome enum + derived `controlEffectiveness` (Effective/Ineffective/Degraded/Compromised); `controlMappings` for multi-framework tagging
- `SiderealIncident` — control failure record; created only in `enforce` execution mode when `controlEffectiveness` is `Ineffective` or `Compromised`; delivers to IR webhook
- `SiderealSystemAlert` — degraded state indicator; requires individual principal acknowledgment before probes resume
- `SiderealAOAuthorization` — AO authorization for detection probes; time-bounded, technique-scoped, namespace-scoped
- `SiderealProbeRecommendation` — discovery-generated probe suggestion; `pending`/`promoted`/`dismissed`/`superseded` lifecycle; primary onboarding surface
- `SiderealReport` — (optional) scheduled report generation; continuous monitoring summaries, POA&M, coverage matrices, evidence packages
- (Custom probe ServiceAccount registrations are configured via Helm values, not a CRD)

**Component separation** (strict privilege isolation):
- **Controller Manager** — orchestrates scheduling; holds only Job-creation + CRD read/write permissions; never holds probe-class permissions directly
- **Probe Runner Jobs** — short-lived, immutable Kubernetes Jobs; one Job per probe execution; TTL-based cleanup; non-root, read-only root filesystem, caps DROP ALL
- **Per-Probe ServiceAccounts** — 7 built-in (`sidereal-controller`, `sidereal-probe-rbac`, `sidereal-probe-netpol`, `sidereal-probe-admission`, `sidereal-probe-secret`, `sidereal-probe-detection`, `sidereal-discovery`) plus operator-registered custom probe ServiceAccounts, each with minimum required RBAC and nothing else

**Detection probe flow**: The probe fires a synthetic syscall pattern and exits; the *controller* independently queries the detection backend (Falco/Tetragon) every 5s for 60s to verify the alert was raised. Two separate identities, two separate actions. Requires active `SiderealAOAuthorization`.

**HMAC result integrity**: Per-execution key derived via HKDF-SHA256 from a KMS-encrypted root Secret. Probe signs result, controller verifies. Invalid signature → `TamperedResult` outcome + `SiderealSystemAlert` + probe surface suspended.

**Pluggable backend interfaces**:
- `DetectionBackend` — Falco gRPC (:50051), Tetragon gRPC (:54321)
- `NetworkPolicyBackend` — Hubble gRPC (:4245), Calico REST (:5443)
- `AuditExportBackend` — Splunk HEC, Elasticsearch, S3 (SSE-KMS + Object Lock COMPLIANCE); configurable export formats: JSON, CEF, LEEF, Syslog (RFC 5424), OCSF

## Key Design Constraints

- `executionMode: dryRun` is the **default** on fresh install; graduated adoption via `observe` → `enforce` requires `sidereal-live-executor` role
- FIPS 199 impact level (`global.impactLevel: high | moderate | low`) cascades defaults for cadence, retention, and fail-closed behavior
- Every probe action carries a mandatory fingerprint label (`sidereal.cloud/probe-id`) — unfingerpinted actions do not execute
- Controller's ServiceAccount may only create Jobs referencing pre-approved probe ServiceAccounts (enforced via admission enforcement policy — Kyverno or OPA per deployment profile)
- A `ResourceQuota` on `sidereal-system` caps concurrent probe Jobs
- Detection probe containers: custom seccomp profile, all capabilities dropped, no network, no volume mounts, no credentials
- Probe images pinned by digest (never by tag); distroless or scratch base; cosign-signed with admission-layer verification at every Pod admission
- FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography exclusively (BoringCrypto for Go, aws-lc-rs for Rust)
- All audit records append-only (admission enforcement policy denies UPDATE/DELETE on SiderealProbeResult)
- `values.schema.json` enforces: `intervalSeconds` 300–86400, retention per impact level, `tls.required` must be true
- Custom probes subject to identical security controls as built-in probes — no escape hatch
- Control mappings are data-driven crosswalk files — agencies can extend frameworks without rebuilding
- Discovery is a core controller capability — primary onboarding is review-and-promote, not author-from-scratch

## Compliance Toolchain

- **Trestle** (IBM/OSCAL Compass) for OSCAL authoring — human-readable markdown compiles to OSCAL JSON
- **Compile**: `trestle assemble component-definition -n sidereal`
- **Validate**: `oscal-cli component-definition validate -f trestle-workspace/component-definitions/sidereal/component-definition.json`
- **Lula** (Defense Unicorns) — deferred; do not include yet

## Key Decisions

- NIST 800-53 **High** baseline as default, but **impact level is configurable** (`high`/`moderate`/`low`) — cascades cadence, retention, and operational defaults
- Self-hosted per-agency deployment model (FedRAMP managed service deferred)
- **Multi-framework compliance mapping**: NIST 800-53, CMMC, CJIS, IRS 1075, HIPAA, NIST 800-171, Kubernetes STIG — configurable via Helm, extensible via custom crosswalk files
- **Graduated execution modes**: `dryRun` → `observe` → `enforce` — ISSOs can validate before activating incident pipelines
- **Deployment profile abstraction**: Sidereal references abstract capabilities, not specific tools. Six pre-built profiles ship: `kyverno-cilium-falco`, `opa-calico-tetragon`, `kyverno-eks`, `opa-aks`, `kyverno-gke`, `opa-rke2`. Custom profiles supported.
- **Namespace label selectors**: `targetNamespaceSelector` in addition to explicit `targetNamespace` — one probe definition covers all matching namespaces
- **NetworkPolicy three verification modes**: `cni-verdict` (Hubble/Calico), `tcp-inference` (any CNI), `responder` (Sidereal-deployed pod)
- **Custom probe extensibility**: Standardized input/output contract for agency-specific probe surfaces
- **Discovery as primary onboarding**: `SiderealProbeRecommendation` CRD with controller-driven discovery — ISSOs review and promote, not author from scratch
- **Report generation**: CLI and optional CRD for continuous monitoring summaries, POA&M, coverage matrices, OSCAL evidence packages
- **SIEM export formats**: JSON (default), CEF, LEEF, Syslog RFC 5424, OCSF — configurable per export target
- **Normalized outcomes**: `controlEffectiveness` (Effective/Ineffective/Degraded/Compromised) derived from raw outcomes — ISSO-facing abstraction
- CVE SLAs: Critical 30 days, High 60 days, Medium 90 days
- Supply chain: cosign signatures + CycloneDX SBOM + SLSA Level 2 provenance + Sigstore Rekor transparency log
- Helm primary delivery, `helm template` static manifests generated in CI

## Git Workflow

**Branching strategy**: Feature branches per implementation phase, merged to `main` via PR.
- Branch naming: `phase-N/short-name` (e.g., `phase-3/hmac`, `phase-4/scheduler`)
- `main` must always be compilable and testable
- Each PR represents a coherent, working increment
- Short-lived branches only — one phase per branch, merged promptly
- No long-lived develop/release branches during the build phase

**Tagging**: `v0.1.0-alpha` after Phases 0-6 (critical path foundation). `v0.1.0` after all probe runners are working.

**Deferred until multi-contributor or public release**:
- Branch protection (requires GitHub Pro/Team or public repo)
- CODEOWNERS enforcement
- Required reviewers
- Gitflow / release branches

## Development Security

- **Commit signing** (active): YubiKey-backed SSH resident keys (`ed25519-sk`); all commits signed and verified on GitHub
- **Branch protection** (deferred): PRs required, signed commits required, status checks required, no force push. Blocked on GitHub plan — will enable when repo goes public or plan is upgraded.
- **CODEOWNERS** (deferred): Security-critical paths (`internal/hmac/`, `detection-probe/`, `build/`, `.github/workflows/`, admission policies) require 2 reviewers. Depends on branch protection.
- **CI hardening**: All GitHub Actions pinned by SHA (not tag); `GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only by default; CI has no access to signing infrastructure
- **Image signing**: Keyless via Sigstore OIDC (Fulcio + Rekor); KMS-backed key as alternative for air-gapped
- **Release gating**: GitHub Environment approval gate — human must approve before signing keys are accessible
- **Dependencies**: Go module proxy (no vendoring); `govulncheck` + `cargo audit` in CI; Dependabot for updates
- **Registry**: GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
- **Account security**: FIDO2/WebAuthn (YubiKey) required for all maintainers — no TOTP/SMS
